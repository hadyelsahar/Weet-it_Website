                            David Robert Joseph Beckham, (born 2 May 1975) is an English footballer who plays
                            midfield for Los Angeles Galaxy in Major League Soccer, having previously played
                            for Manchester United, Preston North End, Real Madrid, and A.C. Milan, as well as
                            the England national team, for whom he holds the all-time appearance record for
                            an outfield player. Beckham's career began when he signed a professional contract
                            with Manchester United, making his first-team debut in 1992 aged 17. During his
                            time there, United won the Premier League title six times, the FA Cup twice, and
                            the UEFA Champions League in 1999. He left Manchester United to sign for Real Madrid
                            in 2003, where he remained for four seasons, clinching the La Liga championship
                            in his final season with the club. In January 2007, it was announced that Beckham
                            would leave Real Madrid for the Major League Soccer club Los Angeles Galaxy, signing
                            a five-year contract with them on 1 July 2007. While a Galaxy player, he spent two
                            loan spells in Italy with Milan in 2009 and 2010. In international football, Beckham
                            made his England debut on 1 September 1996, at the age of 21. He was made captain
                            from 15 November 2000 until the 2006 FIFA World Cup finals, during which he played
                            58 times. He earned a much-publicised hundredth cap against France on 26 March 2008,
                            and became the all-time outfield player appearance record holder on 28 March 2009
                            when he surpassed Bobby Moore's total of 108 caps. With 115 career appearances to
                            date he has stated that he does not intend to retire from international football,
                            having missed the 2010 World Cup through injury and not featuring in England manager
                            Fabio Capello's post-World Cup plans. Beckham has twice been runner-up for FIFA
                            World Player of the Year and in 2004 was the world's highest-paid footballer when
                            taking into account salary and advertising deals. Beckham was the first British
                            footballer to play 100 Champions League matches. He is third in the Premier League's
                            all time time assist provider chart, with 152 assists in 265 appearances. He was
                            Google's most searched of all sports topics in both 2003 and 2004. With such global
                            recognition he has become an elite advertising brand and a top fashion icon. When
                            joining the MLS in 2007 he was given the highest player salary in the league's history,
                            with his playing contract with the Galaxy over the next three years being worth
                            US$6.5m per year. He has been married to singer and fashion designer Victoria Beckham
                            since 1999; they have four children.</p>

                            me coming over to the States is going to make soccer the biggest sport in America.
                            That would be difficult to achieve. Baseball, basketball, American football, they've
                            been around. But I wouldn't be doing this if I didn't think I could make a difference.
